## Background

Today, gambling apps are so easily accessed. Can we help a gambler work out
how much money they have been spending using Open Banking APIs? 

Further, can we help gamblers set limits on how much they spend?

## Pitch

We aim to utilise Open Banking to monitor the user's behaviour on gambling/sport betting related sites/apps and overall financial wellbeing. 

## Key Features:  

- Trend and projection - historical and future projection of gambling spend and personal financial wellness  
- Display future impact calculator  
- Display the impact of gambling on their credit/borrowing risk profile  
- Support information â€“ link the problem gambler to support services  
- Opt-out of gaming advertising and notifications across platforms with notification to all operators  
- Data to assist gaming companies and regulators to monitor the personal and financial well-being of problem gamblers
